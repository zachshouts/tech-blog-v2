# Tech Blog V2

## In Progress

This will be a full stack, tech blog web app. I am currently working on the backend before beginning on the front end. Version 1 of this project was created during my bootcamp using MySQL, Express Handlebars, and Bootstrap. I am refactoring the project to use React, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Express for routing.
